            "text": "Scenarios\n describe the behavior you want MZBench to emulate during the benchmark. If you\nre testing an online store, your scenario will probably include opening a product page and adding the product to cart. For a search service, the scenario may be searching for a random word. You get the idea.\n\n\nIn MZBench, scenarios are .erl files written in a simple \nDSL\n. It looks a lot like Erlang but is much simpler.\n\n\nRead on to learn how to write test scenarios for MZBench.\n\n\nMZBench test scenarios consist of \nlists\n, \ntuples\n, and \natoms\n:\n\n\n\n\nA \nlist\n is a comma-separated sequence enclosed in square brackets: \n[A, B, C]\n\n\nA \ntuple\n is a comma-separated sequence enclosed in curly braces: \n{A, B, C}\n\n\nAtoms\n are reserved words\u2014function names, rate units, conditions. Basically, anything that\ns not a list, a tuple, a number, or a string is an atom: \nprint, make_install, lte, rpm\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe whole scenario is a list of tuples with a dot at the end:\n\n\n[\n    {function1, param1, param2},\n    {function2, [{param_name, param_value}]},\n    ...\n].\n\n\n\n\nEach of these tuples is called a \nstatement\n. A statement represents a function call: the first item is the function name, the others are the params to pass to it. Each param in its turn can also be a list, a tuple, or an atom.\n\n\nSome statements only appear at the top level of a scenario. They\nre called \ntop-level statements\n. There\nre two kinds of top-level statements: \ndirectives\n and \npools\n.\n\n\nSee live examples of MZBench scenarios on GitHub \u2192\n\n\nDirectives\n\n\nDirectives\n prepare the system for the benchmark and clean it up after it. This includes installing an external \nworker\n on test nodes, registering resource files, checking conditions, and executing shell commands before and after the test.\n\n\nmake_install\n\n\n{make_install, [{git, \nURL\n}, {branch, \nBranch\n}, {dir, \nDir\n}]}`\n\n\n\n\nInstall an external worker from a remote git repository on the test nodes before running the benchmark.\n\n\nMZBench downloads the worker and builds a .tgz archive, which is then distributed among the nodes and used in future provisions.\n\n\nThe following actions are executed during \nmake_install\n:\n\n\n$ git clone \nURL\n temp_dir\n$ cd temp_dir\n$ git checkout \nBranch\n\n$ cd \nDir\n\n$ make generate_tgz\n\n\n\n\nIf \nbranch\n is not specified, the default git branch is used.\n\n\nIf \ndir\n is not specified, \n.\n is used.\n\n\ninclude_resource\n\n\n{include_resource, \nResourceName\n, \nFileName\n, \nType\n}\n{include_resource, \nResourceName\n, \nFileURL\n, \nType\n}`\n\n\n\n\nRegister a \nresource file\n as \nResourceName\n.\n\n\nIf the file is on your local machine, put it in the same directory where you invoke \nmzbench run\n.\n\n\nType\n is one of the following atoms:\n\n\n\n\ntext\n\n\nPlain text file, interpreted as a single string.\n\n\njson\n\n\nJSON file. Lists are interpreted as \nErlang lists\n, objects are interpreted as \nErlang maps\n.\n\n\ntsv\n\n\nFile with tabulation separated values, interpreted as a list of lists.\n\n\nerlang\n\n\nErlang source file, interpreted directly as an \nErlang term\n.\n\n\nbinary\n\n\nCustom binary (image, executable, archive, etc.), not interpreted.\n\n\n\n\npre_hook and post_hook\n\n\n{pre_hook, \nActions\n}\n{post_hook, \nActions\n}\n\n\n\n\nRun actions before and after the benchmark. Two kinds of actions are supported: \nexec commands\n and \nworker calls\n:\n\n\nActions = [Action]\nAction = {exec, Target, BashCommand}\n    | {worker_call, WorkerMethod, WorkerModule}\n    | {worker_call, WorkerMethod, WorkerModule, WorkerType}\nTarget = all | director\n\n\n\nExec commands\n let you to run any shell command on all nodes or only on the director node.\n\n\nWorker calls\n are functions defined by the worker. They can be executed only on the director node. Worker calls are used to update the \nenvironment variables\n used in the benchmark.\n\n\nassert\n\n\n{assert, always, \nCondition\n}\n{assert, \nTime\n, \nCondition\n}\n\n\n\n\nCheck if the condition \nCondition\n is satisfied throughout the entire benchmark or at least for the amount of time \nTime\n.\n\n\n\n\nTime\n is a tuple \n{\nDuration\n, (ms|sec|min|h)}\n, e.g. \n{1, sec}\n.\n\n\nCondition\n is a comparison of two value and is defined as a tuple \n{\nOperation\n, \nOperand1\n, \nOperand2\n}\n.\n\n\nOperation\n is one of four atoms:\n\n\n\n\nlt\n\n\nLess than.\n\n\ngt\n\n\nGreater than.\n\n\nlte\n\n\nLess than or equal to.\n\n\ngte\n\n\nGreater than or equal to.\n\n\n\n\nOperand1\n and \nOperand2\n are the values to compare. They can be integers, floats, or \nmetrics\n values.\n\n\nMetrics\n are numerical values collected by the worker during the benchmark. To get the metric value, put its name between double quotation marks:\n\n\n{gt, \nhttp_ok\n, 20}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nhttp_ok\n metric is provided by the \nsimple_http\n worker. This condition passes if the number of successful HTTP responses is greater than 20.    \n\n\nPools\n\n\nPool\n represents a sequence of \njobs\n\u2014statements to run. The statements are defined by the \nworker\n and \nMZBench\ns standard library\n. The jobs are evenly distributed between nodes, so they can be executed in parallel.\n\n\nHere\ns a pool that sends HTTP GET requests to two sites on 10 nodes in parallel:\n\n\n    [ {pool,\n        [ {size, 10}, {worker_type, simple_http} ],\n        [\n            {get, \nhttp://example.com\n},\n            {get, \nhttp://foobar.com\n} \n        ]\n    } ].\n\n\n\n\nThe \nget\n statement is provided by the built-in \nsimple_http\n worker.\n\n\nThe first param in the \npool\n statement is a list of \npool options\n.\n\n\nPool Options\n\n\nsize\n\n\nrequired\n\n\n{size, \nNumberOfJobs\n}`\n\n\n\n\nHow many times you want the pool executed.\n\n\nIf there\ns enough nodes and \nworker_start\n is not set, MZBench will start the jobs simultaneously and run them in parallel.\n\n\nNumberOfJobs\n is any positive number.\n\n\nworker_type\n\n\nrequired\n\n\n{worker_type, \nWorkerName\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe worker that provides statements for the jobs.\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\nA pool uses exactly one worker. If you need multiple workers in the benchmark, just write a pool for each one.\n\n\n\n\nworker_start\n\n\n{worker_start, {linear, \nRate\n}}\n{worker_start, {poisson, \nRate\n}}\n{worker_start, {exp, \nScale\n, \nTime\n}}\n{worker_start, {pow, \nExponent\n, \nScale\n, \nTime\n}}\n\n\n\n\nStart the jobs with a given rate:\n\n\n\n\nlinear\n\n\nConstant rate \nRate\n, e.g. 10 per minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate\n is a tuple \n{\nN\n, (rps|rpm|rph)}\n, e.g. \n{10, rps}\n. It means \nN\n jobs per second, minute, or hour.\n\n\n\n\npoisson\n\n\nRate defined by a \nPoisson process\n with \u03bb = \nRate\n.\n\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\nStart jobs with \nexponentially growing\n rate with the scale factor \nScale\n:\n\n\nScale \u00d7 e\nTime\n\n\n\n\npow\n\n\n\n\nStart jobs with rate growing as a \npower function\n with the exponent \nExponent\n and the scale factor \nScale\n:\n\n\nScale \u00d7 Time\nExponent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can customize and combine rates:\n\n\nthink_time\n\n\n{think_time, \nTime\n, \nRate\n}\n\n\n\n\nStart jobs with rate \nRate\n for a second, then sleep for \nTime\n and repeat.\n\n\nramp\n\n\n{ramp, linear, \nStartRate\n, \nEndRate\n}\n\n\n\n\nLinearly change the rate from \nStartRate\n at the beginning of the pool to \nEndRate\n at its end.\n\n\ncomb\n\n\n{comb, \nRate1\n, \nTime1\n, \nRate2\n, \nTime2\n, ...}\n\n\n\n\nStart jobs with rate \nRate1\n for \nTime1\n, then switch to \nRate2\n for \nTime2\n, etc.\n\n\nLoops\n\n\nLoop\n is a sequence of statements executed over and over for a given time.\n\n\nA loop looks similar to a \npool\n\u2014it consists of a list of \noptions\n and a list statements to run:\n\n\n{loop, [\n        {time, \nTime\n},\n        {rate, \nRate\n},\n        {parallel, \nN\n},\n        {iterator, \nName\n},\n        {spawn, \nSpawn\n}\n    ],\n    [\n        \nStatement1\n,\n        \nStatement2\n,\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere\ns a loop that sends HTTP GET requests for 30 seconds with a growing rate of 1 \u2192 5 rps:\n\n\n{loop, [\n        {time, {30, sec}},\n        {rate, {ramp, linear, {1, rps}, {5, rps}}}\n    ],\n    [\n        {get, \nhttp://example.com\n}\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can put loops inside loops. Here\ns a nested loop that sends HTTP GET requests for 30 seconds, increasing the rate by 1 rps every three seconds:\n\n\n{loop, [\n        {time, {30, sec}},\n        {rate, {10, rpm}},\n        {iterator, \ni\n}\n    ],\n    [\n        {loop, [\n                {time, {3, sec}}, \n                {rate, {{var, \ni\n}, rps}}\n            ],\n            [\n                {get, \nhttp://google.com\n}\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between these two examples is that in the first case the rate is growing smoothly and in the second one it\ns growing in steps.\n\n\nLoop options\n\n\ntime\n\n\nrequired\n\n\n{time, \nTime\n}\n\n\n\n\nRun the loop for \nTime\n.\n\n\nrate\n\n\n{rate, \nRate\n}\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the loop with the \nRate\n rate.\n\n\nparallel\n\n\n{parallel, \nN\n}\n\n\n\n\nRun \nN\n iterations of the loop in parallel.\n\n\niterator\n\n\n{iterator, \nIterName\n}\n\n\n\n\nDefine a variable named \nIterName\n inside the loop that contains the current iteration number. It can be accessed with \n{var, \nIterName\n}\n.\n\n\nspawn\n\n\n{spawn, (true|false)}\n\n\n\n\nIf \ntrue\n, every iteration runs in a separate, spawned process. Default is \nfalse\n.\n\n\nResource Files\n\n\nResource file\n is an external data source for the benchmark.\n\n\nTo declare a resource file for the benchmark, use \ninclude_resource\n.\n\n\nOnce the resource file is registered, its content can be included at any place in the scenario using the \nresource\n statement: \n{resource, \nResourceName\n}\n.\n\n\nFor example, suppose we have a file \nnames.json\n:\n\n\n[\n    \"Bob\",\n    \"Alice\",\n    \"Guido\"\n]\n\n\n\nHere\ns how you can use this file in a scenario:\n\n\n[\n    {include_resource, names, \nnames.json\n, json},\n    {pool, [\n            {size, 3},\n            {worker_type, dummy_worker}\n        ],\n        [\n            {loop, [\n                    {time, {5, sec}},\n                    {rate, {1, rps}}\n                ],\n                [\n                    {print, {choose, {resource, names}}} % print a random name from the file\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n].\n\n\n\n\nStandard Library\n\n\nEnvironment Variables\n\n\nEnvironment variables\n are global values that can be accessed at any point of the benchmark. They are useful to store the benchmark global state like its total duration, or global params like the execution speed.\n\n\nTo set an environment variable, call \nmzbench\n with the \n--env\n param:\n\n\n$ ./bin/mzbench run --env foo=bar --env n=42\n\n\n\n\nvar\n\n\n{var, \nVarName\n}\n{var, \nVarName\n, \nDefaultValue\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo get the value of a variable, refer to it by the name: \n{var, \"\nVarName\n\"}\n.\n\n\n{var, \nfoo\n} % returns \nbar\n\n{var, \nn\n} % returns \n42\n, a string\n\n\n\n\nIf you refer to an undefined variable, the benchmark crashes. You can avoid this by setting a default value for the variable: \n{var, \"\nVarName\n\", \nDefaultValue\n}\n:\n\n\n{var, \nanothervar\n, \nFoo\n} % returns \nFoo\n if anothervar is not set\n\n\n\n\nnumvar\n\n\n{numvar, \nVarName\n}\n{numvar, \nVarName\n, \nDefaultValue\n}\n\n\n\n\nBy default, variable values are considered strings. To get a numerical value (integer or float), use \n{numvar, \"VarName\"}\n:\n\n\n{numvar, \nn\n} % returns 42, an integer.\n\n\n\n\nParallelization and Syncing\n\n\nparallel\n\n\n{parallel, \nStatement1\n, \nStatement2\n, ...}\n\n\n\n\nExecute multiple statements in parallel. Unlike executing statements in a pool, this way all statements are executed on the same node.\n\n\nset_signal\n\n\n{set_signal, \nSignalName\n}\n{set_signal, \nSignalName\n, \nCount\n]}\n\n\n\n\nEmit a global signal \nSignalName\n.\n\n\nIf \nCount\n is specified, the signal is emitted \nCount\n times.\n\n\nSignalName\n is a string, atom, number, or, in fact, any \nErlang term\n.\n\n\nwait_signal\n\n\n{wait_signal, \nSignalName\n}\n{wait_signal, \nSignalName\n, \nCount\n}\n\n\n\n\nWait for the global signal \nSignalName\n to be emitted.

It would be impossible in practice for MZBench distribution to provide an extensive library of functions to access all the possible services and protocols. Instead, it uses a plugin system called \nworkers\n.\n\n\nA \nworker\n is an Erlang application providing a set of MZBench DSL statements to access a particular service (such as HTTP or SSH server) and collecting a set of statistics about its usage. A small set of standard \nworkers\n is provided with the distribution, but you will likely need to write your own to access the service you want to benchmark. This document is here to guide you through this process.\n\n\nBecause a MZBench \nworker\n is an Erlang application, you need some basic knowledge of this programming language to understand this document. You can refer yourself to \nGetting Started with Erlang User\ns Guide\n or to the \nLearn You Some Erlang for great good!\n book for an introduction to the matter.\n\n\nCommand line utilities\n\n\nMZBench distribution provide some command line utilities to assist you during your \nworker\n development effort.\n\n\nNew worker generation\n\n\nFirst of all, you can generate an empty \nworker\n application using the following command (here and later \nMZBENCH_SRC\n means the path to the MZBench source code):\n\n\nMZBENCH_SRC\n/bin/mzbench new_worker \nworker_name\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a new directory \nworker_name\n containing a minimalistic, but fully functional MZBench \nworker\n named \nworker_name\n. Particularly interesting generated files are \nsrc/\nworker_name\n.erl\n containing the \nworker\n source code and \nexamples/\nworker_name\n.erl\n containing a simple MZBench scenario using it.\n\n\nIf the service you want to access is based on some well known protocol, such as TCP, the \nnew_worker\n command can generate your a more elaborate \nworker\n already containing the usual boilerplate code for this type of service. You can obtain a list of available protocols by executing:\n\n\nMZBENCH_SRC\n/bin/mzbench list_templates\n\n\n\nThen generate your \nworker\n by adding an additional parameter to the \nnew_worker\n command:\n\n\nMZBENCH_SRC\n/bin/mzbench new_worker --template \nprotocol\n \nworker_name\n\n\n\n\nWorker compilation and debugging\n\n\nDuring any serious development, you will certainly need a to do a lot of debugging. If every time you want to launch your test scenario you would need to commit your \nworker\n to a remote Git repository and to launch a complete benchmark, it would be cumbersome. So MZBench provide you with a way to quickly build your worker and launch a local instance of your benchmarking scenario using it.\n\n\nInside your \nworker\n source code directory (the root one, not the \nsrc\n), execute the following command replacing \nscript\n by the path to the benchmarking scenario you want to run:\n\n\nMZBENCH_SRC\n/bin/mzbench run_local \nscript\n\n\n\n\nYou can pass the environment variables using the \n--env\n option. But, please note that all \nmake_install\n top-level statements will be ignored in this execution mode.\n\n\nWorker execution\n\n\nAfter you have done with debugging, you need to execute your worker in a cloud. To do that, you need to specify worker git address at your benchmark script with \n{make_install, [{git, \nURL\n}, {branch, \nBranch\n}, {dir, \nDir\n}]}\n, \nhttp worker example\n.\n\n\nGeneral worker structure\n\n\nAn MZBench \nworker\n provides a set of DSL statements (i.e. sub-routines) and a set of metrics. The different sub-routines need not to be independent as the worker can have internal state.\n\n\nTo understand the general structure of a \nworker\n, let see the source code of the \ndummy_worker\n provided with the MZBench distribution:\n\n\n-module(dummy_worker).\n-export([initial_state/0, metrics/0,\n         print/3]).\n\n-include(\"mzb_types.hrl\").\n\n-type state() :: string().\n-type meta() :: [{Key :: atom(), Value :: any()}].\n\n-type graph_group() :: {group, Name :: string(), [graph()]}\n                     | graph().\n-type graph()       :: {graph, Opts :: #{metrics =\n [metric()],\n                                         units =\n string(),\n                                         title =\n string()}}\n                     | [metric()]\n                     | metric().\n-type metric()      :: {Name :: string(), Type :: metric_type() }\n                     | {Name :: string(), Type :: metric_type(), Opts :: map() }.\n-type metric_type() :: counter | gauge | histogram.\n\n-spec initial_state() -\n state().\ninitial_state() -\n [].\n\n-spec metrics() -\n [graph_group()].\nmetrics() -\n [{group, \"Application Metrics\", [\n                {graph, #{ title =\n \"Dummy counter\",\n                           units =\n \"budger\",\n                           metrics =\n [{\"dummy_counter\", counter}]}}\n             ]}].\n\n-spec print(state(), meta(), string()) -\n {nil, state()}.\nprint(State, Meta, Text) -\n\n    mzb_metrics:notify({\"dummy_counter\", counter}, 1),\n    lager:info(\"Printing ~p, Meta: ~p~n\", [Text, Meta]),\n    {nil, State}.\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, it export\ns 3 functions: \ninitial_state/0\n, \nmetrics/0\n and \nprint/3\n. First two of them are mandatory for any \nworker\n. \n\n\ninitial_state/0\n function can return anything and is used to initialize the \nworker\n initial state. Each parallel execution job have its own state, so this function will be called once per job start.\n\n\nmetrics/0\n function is also mandatory. It return a group of metrics generated by this \nworker\n. Please refer yourself to \nHow to define metrics\n for further reference concerning this function.\n\n\nAll the remaining exported functions defines the DSL statements provided by this \nworker\n. You can, of course, provide none, although such a \nworker\n wouldn\nt be very useful. The \ndummy_worker\n, for instance, provide the \nprint\n statement useful to output some string of characters to the standard output. Refer yourself to \nHow to define statements\n for a more detailed discussion on this topic.\n\n\nHow to define statements\n\n\nTo define a DSL statement provided by your \nworker\n you export an Erlang function that will be called when such a statement is encountered. The exported function is of the following general form:\n\n\nstatement_name\n(State, Meta, [\nParam1\n, [\nParam2\n, ...]]) -\n\n    {ReturnValue, NewState}.\n\n\n\nThe function must have the same name as the statement it defines. It must take at least two parameters: the \nworker\n internal state at the moment the statement is executed and \nmeta\n information proplist. The function can also accept any number of other parameters. They correspond to the parameters of the statement.\n\n\nThe statement function must return a tuple of two values. The first one is the return value of statement. You must return \nnil\n if your statement has no return value. The second member of the tuple is the next \nworker\n state. Each statement is processed sequentially and using previous state except internal statements of {parallel} section and iterations within a loop having parallel \n 1. In these cases statements within the same thread will share one sequence of statements and other parallel threads wont. Final state of the whole {parallel} or {loop} statement will be the very first one (from the first \nthread\n), other thread\ns states will not affect the final one.\n\n\nFor example, the following function:\n\n\nfoo(State, Meta, X, Y) -\n\n    {nil, State}.\n\n\n\nCan be called as \n{foo, X, Y}\n from a benchmarking scenario.\n\n\nMetrics\n\n\nMetrics are numerical values collected during the scenario execution. They are the main result of your \nworker\n and represent the values you want to evaluate with your benchmark.\n\n\nMetric types\n\n\nThe MZBench currently support three types of metrics:\n\n\n\n\ncounter\n - A single additive value. New values are simply added to the current one.\n\n\ngauge\n - A single non additive value. New value replaces the previous one.\n\n\nhistogram\n - A set of numerical values that quantify a distribution of values. New values are added to the distribution.\n\n\nderived\n - metric value is evaluated periodically using user defined function based on other metric values (see \nDerived metrics\n for more details).\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you are consuming TCP packets of various sizes and you want to track overall amount of data being transferred \u2014 you need \ncounter\n and if you are interested in its distribution: mean size, 50 percentile and so on \u2014 you need a \nhistogram\n.\n\n\nDeclaring metrics\n\n\nYou declare the groups of metrics collected by your \nworker\n in the list returned by the \nmetrics/0\n function. Each group corresponds to a structure with following spec:\n\n\ngraph_group() :: {group, Name :: string(), [graph()]}\n               | graph().\ngraph()       :: {graph, Opts :: #{metrics =\n [metric()],\n                                   units =\n string(),\n                                   title =\n string()}}\n               | [metric()]\n               | metric().\nmetric()      :: {Name :: string(), Type :: metric_type() }\n               | {Name :: string(), Type :: metric_type(), Opts :: map()}.\nmetric_type() :: counter | gauge | histogram.\n\n\n\nThis structure supports a three-level hierarchy:\n\n\n\n\nGroup of graphs is placed on the top of this hierarchy. It consists of the one or more graphs and define a group of graphs under the same name.\n\n\nGraph consists of the one or more metrics that will be plotted on the same chart. Furthermore, you could specify additional option for the chart (e.g. units, title etc)\n\n\nMetric is the lowest unit of this hierarchy. It specifies the name and type of the user-defined metric.\n\n\n\n\nLet see the following metrics declaration:\n\n\nmetrics() -\n [{group, \"HTTP Requests\", [\n                {graph, #{metrics =\n [{\"success_requests\", counter}, {\"failed_requests\", counter}]}},\n                {graph, #{title =\n \"Request's latency\",\n                          units =\n \"ms\",\n                          metrics =\n [{\"latency\", histogram}]}}]}].\n\n\n\nIn this example, a group of graphs with name \nHTTP Requests\n will be created. It will consist of the several graphs presented the number of success/failed requests and the request\ns latencies. Please note then a graph could produce several charts. In the mentioned example, the graph for success and failed request will produce two charts: absolute counters and their rps.\n\n\nDerived metrics\n\n\nDerived metrics are basically gauges which are evaluated on the director node every ~10sec. To define a derived metric \nresolver\n function should be specified in metric opts dictionary. Resolver function is used to evaluate metric value.\nTypical example of the derived metrics is the current number of pending requests. We specify a function (pending_requests) to calculate the metric value in metrics options and then define the function as simple difference between number of sent requests and number of reeived responses:\n\n\nmetrics() -\n [{group, \"Requests\", [\n                {graph, #{metrics =\n [\n                    {\"requests_sent\", counter},\n                    {\"responses_received\", counter},\n                    {\"pending_requests\", derived, #{resolver =\n pending_requests}}]}},\n                ]}].\n\npending_requests() -\n\n    mzb_metrics:get_value(\"requests_sent\") - mzb_metrics:get_value(\"responses_received\").\n\n\n\nHooks\n\n\nPre and post hooks allow to run a custom code before or after benchmark. Hooks could be applied on every nodes or on the director node only. You are able to change any environment variable in your hook handler and use it in your scenario.\n\n\nScenario:\n\n\n{pre_hook, [\n    {exec, all, \"yum install zlib\"},\n    {worker_call, fetch_commit, my_worker}\n]}\n\n{pool, [{size, 3}, {worker_type, dummy_worker}], [\n    {loop, [{time, {1, sec}},\n            {rate, {ramp, linear, {10, rps}, {50, rps}}}],\n        [{print, {var, \"commit\", \"default\"}}]}]},\n\n\n\nWorker:\n\n\nfetch_commit(Env) -\n\n    {ok, [{\"commit\", \"0123456\"} | Env]}.\n\n\n\nUpdating metrics\n\n\nYou can update a declared metric from anywhere inside your \nworker\n. Simply call the following function:\n\n\nmzb_metrics:notify({\"\nmetric_name\n\", \nmetric_type\n}, \nvalue\n)\n\n\n\nThe tuple \n{\"\nmetric_name\n\", \nmetric_type\n}\n is the same that was used during the metric declaration and identifies the metric to update. The \nvalue\n is the value to add to the metric.",

Installation\nand configuration of the Graphite host is not covered. The Graphite host is\n optional, although you will certainly need it for any serious use.\n\n\nMZBench architecture\n\n\nIn its more general form, a complete MZBench installation consists of several separate hosts:\n\n\n\n\nAn MZBench API server that accepts the client requests and provides the dashboard\n\n\nA metric gathering host, usually Graphite, providing the graph plotting services\n\n\nA set of hosts to use as a worker nodes\n\n\n\n\nThe API server and Graphite hosts are permanent, while the worker nodes can be dynamically\nallocated when needed, for example on Amazon.\n\n\nServer installation\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nTo run an MZBench API server, you need to install the following packages:\n\n\n\n\nA C++ compiler\n\n\nErlang R17 distribution (http://www.erlang.org)\n\n\nPython v2.6 (https://www.python.org)\n\n\nPIP Python package manager (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)\n\n\n\n\nServer installation\n\n\nTo install the MZBench API server, perform the following commands:\n\n\n# Clone the current MZBench source code\ngit clone https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench.git\n\n# Install additional Python packages\nsudo pip install -r mzbench/requirements.txt\n\n# Start the server\n./mzbench/bin/mzbench start_server\n\n# Stop the server\n./mzbench/bin/mzbench stop_server\n\n\n\nServer configuration\n\n\nTo apply configuration changes you need to restart the server if it\ns running.\n\n\nConfiguration file format\n\n\nThe MZBench server parameters are set in configuration file.\nIt can be passed as an argument to bin/mzbench start_server command.\n\n\nFor example: bin/mzbench start_server \nconfig ./server.config\n\n\nBy default, the server tries to load configuration from the following places:\n\n\n~/.config/mzbench/server.config\n/etc/mzbench/server.config\n\n\nThe configuraion file is essentially an Erlang term. At the top level, it is a list of tuples, terminated by the dot.\n Each tuple represent a configuration category. Its first element is an atom identifying the\n category, its second element is a list of actual parameters. Each of parameters is a tuple\n  by itself, containing the parameter name and the value.\n\n\nFor the sake of clarity, let\ns see the following example configuration:\n\n\n[\n    {mzbench_api, [\n        {graphite, \"172.21.8.192\"},\n        {listen_port, 80}\n    ]}\n].\n\n\n\nIt contains only one category: \nmzbench_api\n. This category is used for the parameters of the server itself.\n\n\nHere, we specify two parameters: \ngraphite\n and \nlisten_port\n. \ngraphite\n specifies the IP\n address of the host containing the Graphite server to use (here \n172.21.8.192\n). \nlisten_port\n\n specifies which port should be used to access the server dashboard (here \n80\n).\n\n\nServer parameters (\nmzbench_api\n)\n\n\nThese parameters are going to the \nmzbench_api\n category.\n\n\n{cloud_plugins, [{Name :: atom(), Opts :: #{}}]}\n\n\nPlugins responsible for node allocation, [{dummy, #{module =\n mzb_dummycloud_plugin}}] by default.\nName represents the name of the particular instance of plugin and could be any atom.\nOpts must contain either module or application key, other keys in Opts depend on particular plugin type.\nIt is possible to specify several plugins. The actually used plugin can be specified with \ncloud option of the bin/mzbench utility.\nThere are three cloud plugins available in mzbench so far. See below for configuration details and a few examples.\nSee also: \nCloud plugin creation guide\n\n\nConfiguration of the AWS EC2 cloud plugin\n\n\nmzb_api_ec2_plugin module allocates hosts in EC2 and requires \ninstance_spec\n and \nconfig\n keys to be specified in Opts (see above).\nFor AWS specific configuration details, see \nerlcloud documentation\n.\nAWS image tips: an image should contain Erlang R17, gcc, gcc-c++, git, sudo.\nsudo shoud be available for non-tty execution (put \nDefaults !requiretty\n to /etc/sudoers).\nIt is also required to have ssh and tcp 4801/4802 ports connectivity between server and nodes for\nlogs and metrics. Please refer EC2 documentation on image publish process, it can be done from\nweb AWS console within few clicks. We prepared such image with Amazon Linux (ami-3b90a80b), but you\nmay require some additional software.
