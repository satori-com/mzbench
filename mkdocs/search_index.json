Think of it as a simple ident-based (like python) language with a small set of instructions and measurement units.\n\n\nMZBench test scenarios consist of function calls and multi-line statements. Function name is \nidentifier\n. Indetifier is lower-case letter sequence with numbers and underscore which starts from letter. Function could accept positional arguments or key arguments. Position arguments are values, key arguments are values with values, for example:\n\n\nmultiline(param1 = 10, param2 = 20):\n    function1(1, 2)\n    function2(param1 = function3(1), param2 = 2)\n    ...\n\n\n\n\nFunction value could be used in some cases, in the example above \nfunction3\n value is used to pass to function2.\n\n\nSome statements only appear at the top level of a scenario. They\nre called \ntop-level statements\n. There\nre two kinds of top-level statements: \ndirectives\n and \npools\n.\n\n\nSee live examples of MZBench scenarios on GitHub \u2192\n\n\nDirectives\n\n\nDirectives\n prepare the system for the benchmark and clean it up after it. This includes installing an external \nworker\n on test nodes, registering resource files, checking conditions, and executing shell commands before and after the test.\n\n\nTop-Level Directives\n\n\nAll top-level directives are optional.\n\n\nmake_install git\n\n\nmake_install(git = \nURL\n, branch = \nBranch\n, dir = \nDir\n)\n\n\n\n\nInstall an external worker from a remote git repository on the test nodes before running the benchmark.\n\n\nMZBench downloads the worker and builds a .tgz archive, which is then distributed among the nodes and used in future provisions.\n\n\nThe following actions are executed during \nmake_install\n:\n\n\n$ git clone \nURL\n temp_dir\n$ cd temp_dir\n$ git checkout \nBranch\n\n$ cd \nDir\n\n$ make generate_tgz\n\n\n\n\nIf \nbranch\n is not specified, the default git branch is used.\n\n\nIf \ndir\n is not specified, \n.\n is used.\n\n\nmake_install rsync\n\n\nmake_install(rsync = \nlocation\n, exclude = \nsubdir\n)\n\n\n\n\nInstall an external worker with rsync on the test nodes before running the benchmark.

MZBench ships with workers for HTTP and XMPP protocols and a worker that executes console commands, and in many cases they are enough. But if you need to test a specific service, you\nll probably need to write a worker for it.\n\n\nA \nworker\n can be implemented in either \nErlang\n or \nPython\n programming languages. Please note that the support for Erlang programming language is a little bit more complete.\n\n\nHow to Write a Worker\n\n\nCommand Line Utilities\n\n\nMZBench distribution provides \ncommand line utilities\n to assist you during your development effort.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAll command examples below are executed in the MZBench directory.

Refer to \nGetting Started with Erlang User\ns Guide\n or to the \nLearn You Some Erlang for great good!\n book for an introduction to Erlang.\n\n\n\n\nThe Erlang Worker Structure\n\n\nA worker provides DSL statements and metrics. The statements need not to be independent as the worker can have internal state.\n\n\nTo understand the general structure of a worker, let\ns see the source code of the \nsimple_http_worker\n provided with the MZBench distribution:\n\n\n-module(simple_http_worker).\n\n-export([initial_state/0, metrics/0,\n         get/3]).\n\ninitial_state() -\n [].\n\nmetrics() -\n\n    [\n        {group, \nSummary\n, [\n            {graph, #{title =\n \nHTTP Response\n,\n                      units =\n \nN\n,\n                      metrics =\n [{\nhttp_ok\n, counter}, {\nhttp_fail\n, counter}, {\nother_fail\n, counter}]}},\n            {graph, #{title =\n \nLatency\n,\n                      units =\n \nmicroseconds\n,\n                      metrics =\n [{\nlatency\n, histogram}]}}\n        ]}\n    ].\n\nget(State, _Meta, URL) -\n\n    StartTime = os:timestamp(),\n    Response = hackney:request(get, list_to_binary(URL), [], \n, []),\n\n    case Response of\n        {ok, _, _, BodyRef} -\n hackney:skip_body(BodyRef);\n        _ -\n ok\n    end,\n\n    Latency = timer:now_diff(os:timestamp(), StartTime),\n    mzb_metrics:notify({\nlatency\n, histogram}, Latency),\n\n    case Response of\n        {ok, 200, _, _} -\n\n            mzb_metrics:notify({\nhttp_ok\n, counter}, 1);\n        {ok, _, _, _} = Reply -\n\n            lager:error(\nGET failed: ~p\n, [Reply]),\n            mzb_metrics:notify({\nhttp_fail\n, counter}, 1);\n        E -\n\n            lager:error(\nhackney:request failed: ~p\n, [E]),\n            mzb_metrics:notify({\nother_fail\n, counter}, 1)\n    end,\n    {nil, State}.\n\n\n\n\nIt exports three functions: \ninitial_state/0\n, \nmetrics/0\n, and \nget/3\n. The first two are mandatory for any worker. \n\n\n\n\ninitial_state/0\n\n\nSet the worker\ns initial state. Each parallel job has its own state, so this function will be called once per job start.\n\n\nmetrics/0\n\n\nReturn a group of metrics generated by this worker. \nDeclaring Metrics\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the exported functions define the BDL statements provided by this worker. You can, of course, provide none, although such a worker wouldn\nt be very useful. The \nsimple_http_worker\n, for instance, provides the \nget\n statement to fetch particular HTTP document.\n\n\nHow to Define Statements\n\n\nTo define a BDL statement provided by your worker, export an Erlang function that will be called when this statement is encountered:\n\n\nstatement_name\n(State, Meta, [\nParam1\n, [\nParam2\n, ...]]) -\n\n    {ReturnValue, NewState}.\n\n\n\n\nThe function has the same name as the statement it defines. It accepts at least two parameters: the worker internal state at the moment the statement is executed and \nmeta\n information proplist. The function can also accept any number of other parameters. They correspond to the parameters of the statement.\n\n\nFor example, this function:\n\n\nfoo(State, Meta, X, Y) -\n\n    {nil, State}.\n\n\n\n\nis called as \nfoo(X, Y)\n from a benchmarking scenario.\n\n\nIf you want to use key arguments at your function call as \nfoo(x = 1, y = 2)\n, you need to declare three argument function foo and expect third parameter to be \nproplist\n. For example:\n\n\nfoo(State, Meta, Proplist) -\n\n    1 = proplists:get_value(x, Proplist),\n    2 = proplists:get_value(y, Proplist),\n    {nil, State}.\n\n\n\n\nThe statement function must return a tuple of two values:\n\n\n\n\nthe return value of statement; return \nnil\n if your statement has no return value\n\n\nthe next worker state\n\n\n\n\nStatements are processed sequentially; each statement receives the state from the previous one and passes it further.\n\n\nTwo exceptions are the statements within the \nparallel\n section and iterations within a \nloop\n with \nparallel \n 1\n. In these cases the statements within the same thread share the same sequence of statements, which parallel threads don\nt. The final state of the whole \nparallel\n or \nloop\n statement is the one from the first \nthread\n; other threads\n states don\nt affect the final state.\n\n\nMetrics\n\n\nMetrics are numerical values collected during the scenario execution. They are the main result of your worker and represent the values you want to evaluate with your benchmark.\n\n\nMetric Types\n\n\nMZBench currently support four types of metrics:\n\n\n\n\ncounter\n\n\nA single additive value. New values are simply added to the current one.\n\n\ngauge\n\n\nA single non-additive value. New value replaces the previous one.\n\n\nhistogram\n\n\nA set of numerical values that quantify a distribution of values. New values are added to the distribution.\n\n\nderived\n\n\nEvaluated periodically using user-defined function based on another metric values. \nLearn more\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you are consuming TCP packets of various sizes and you want to track overall amount of data being transferred, use \ncounter\n. If you are interested in its distribution\u2013mean size, 50 percentile, and so on\u2013you need a \nhistogram\n.\n\n\nDeclaring Metrics\n\n\nDeclare the groups of metrics collected by your worker in the list returned by \nmetrics/0\n. Each group corresponds to a structure with following spec:\n\n\ngraph_group() :: {group, Name :: string(), [graph()]}\n               | graph().\ngraph()       :: {graph, Opts :: #{metrics =\n [metric()],\n                                   units =\n string(),\n                                   title =\n string()}}\n               | [metric()]\n               | metric().\nmetric()      :: {Name :: string(), Type :: metric_type() }\n               | {Name :: string(), Type :: metric_type(), Opts :: map()}.\nmetric_type() :: counter | gauge | histogram.\n\n\n\n\nThis structure has a three-level hierarchy:\n\n\n\n\nGroup of graphs is placed on the top of this hierarchy. It consists of one or more graphs and defines a group of graphs under the same name.\n\n\nGraph consists of one or more metrics that will be plotted on the same chart. Furthermore, you could specify additional options for the chart: units, title, etc.\n\n\nMetric is the lowest unit of this hierarchy. It specifies the name and type of the user-defined metric.\n\n\n\n\nLet\ns see the following metrics declaration:\n\n\nmetrics() -\n [{group, \nHTTP Requests\n, [\n                {graph, #{metrics =\n [{\nsuccess_requests\n, counter}, {\nfailed_requests\n, counter}]}},\n                {graph, #{title =\n \nRequest's latency\n,\n                          units =\n \nms\n,\n                          metrics =\n [{\nlatency\n, histogram}]}}]}].\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, a group of graphs with the name \nHTTP Requests\n is created. It consists of several graphs representing the number of successful and failed requests and the request latencies.\n\n\nA graph can produce several charts. In the example above, the graph for successful and failed request produces two charts: absolute counters and their rps.\n\n\nDerived Metrics\n\n\nDerived metrics are basically gauges which are evaluated on the director node every ~10sec. To define a derived metric, specify the \nresolver\n function in the metric opts dictionary. This function is used to evaluate the metric value.\n\n\nTypical example of a derived metric is the current number of pending requests. We specify a function (\npending_requests\n) to calculate the metric value in the metric options and then define the function as simple difference between the number of sent requests and received responses:\n\n\nmetrics() -\n [{group, \nRequests\n, [\n                {graph, #{metrics =\n [\n                    {\nrequests_sent\n, counter},\n                    {\nresponses_received\n, counter},\n                    {\npending_requests\n, derived, #{resolver =\n pending_requests}}]}},\n                ]}].\n\npending_requests() -\n\n    mzb_metrics:get_value(\nrequests_sent\n) - mzb_metrics:get_value(\nresponses_received\n).\n\n\n\n\nHooks\n\n\nPre and post hooks\n let you run custom code before and after a benchmark. Hooks can be applied on every node or only on the director node. You can change any environment variable in your hook handler and use it in your scenario.\n\n\nScenario:\n\n\npre_hook():\n    exec(all, \nyum install mylib\n)\n    worker_call(fetch_url, simple_http_worker)\n\npool(size = 3, worker_type = simple_http_worker):\n    loop(time = 1 sec,\n         rate = ramp(linear, 10 rps, 50 rps)):\n        get(var(\nurl\n, \nhttp://mydomain.com\n))\n\n\n\n\nWorker:\n\n\nfetch_url(Env) -\n\n    {ok, [{\nurl\n, \nhttp://mycdn.com/myresource\n} | Env]}.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Metrics\n\n\nYou can update a metric from anywhere inside your worker. Simply call the following function:\n\n\nmzb_metrics:notify({\nmetric_name\n, \nmetric_type\n}, \nvalue\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe tuple \n{\"\nmetric_name\n\", \nmetric_type\n}\n is the same that was used during the metric declaration and identifies the metric to update. \nvalue\n is the value to add to the metric.\n\n\nHow to write a Python worker\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou need a basic knowledge about the Python programming language to understand this tutorial. Refer to \nThe Python Tutorial\n for an introduction to Python.\n\n\n\n\nThe Python Worker Structure\n\n\nA worker provides DSL statements and metrics. The statements need not to be independent as the worker can have internal state.\n\n\nTo understand the general structure of a worker, let\ns see the source code of the \npython_empty\n worker template provided with the MZBench distribution:\n\n\nimport random\nimport mzbench\n\ndef initial_state():\n    pass\n\n\ndef metrics():\n    return [\n        [\n            ('print', 'counter'),\n            ('print_2', 'counter')\n        ],\n        ('dummy', 'histogram')\n    ]\n\n\ndef my_print(msg):\n    mzbench.notify(('print', 'counter'), 1)\n    mzbench.notify(('print_2', 'counter'), 2)\n\n    print \n{0}\n.format(msg)\n\n    mzbench.notify(('dummy', 'histogram'), random.uniform(0, 1000000000)/7)\n\n\n\n\nIt contains three functions: \ninitial_state()\n, \nmetrics()\n, and \nmy_print()\n. The first two are mandatory for any worker. \n\n\n\n\ninitial_state()\n\n\nUseful to initialize the worker\ns initial state. Each parallel job has its own separate Python interpreter process, so this function will be called once per job start.\n\n\nmetrics()\n\n\nReturn a group of metrics generated by this worker. \nDeclaring Metrics in Python\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the exported functions define the DSL statements provided by this worker. You can, of course, provide none, although such a worker wouldn\nt be very useful. The \npython_empty\n worker, for instance, provides the \nmy_print\n statement to output a string to the standard output.\n\n\nHow to Define Statements\n\n\nTo define a DSL statement provided by your worker, write a Python function that will be called when this statement is encountered:\n\n\ndef \nstatement_name\n([\nParam1\n, [\nParam2\n, ...]]):\n    [return \nReturnValue\n]\n\n\n\n\nThe function has the same name as the statement it defines. It can accept any number of parameters, they correspond to the parameters of the statement.\n\n\nFor example, this function:\n\n\ndef foo(X, Y):\n    pass\n\n\n\n\nis called as \nfoo(X, Y)\n from a benchmarking scenario.\n\n\nThe statement function may return a value corresponding to the return value of the statement or nothing if the statement has no return value.\n\n\nStatements are processed sequentially in the same interpreter, so the values of the global variables are conserved between calls.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPlease beware that the \nparallel\n section and \nparallel \n 1\n option of the \nloop\n \ncan\nt and shouldn\nt be used with the Python based workers.\n\n\n\n\nMetrics\n\n\nMetrics are numerical values collected during the scenario execution. They are the main result of your worker and represent the values you want to evaluate with your benchmark.\n\n\nMetric Types\n\n\nMZBench currently support three types of metrics with the Python based workers:\n\n\n\n\ncounter\n\n\nA single additive value. New values are simply added to the current one.\n\n\ngauge\n\n\nA single non-additive value. New value replaces the previous one.\n\n\nhistogram\n\n\nA set of numerical values that quantify a distribution of values. New values are added to the distribution.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you are consuming TCP packets of various sizes and you want to track overall amount of data being transferred, use \ncounter\n. If you are interested in its distribution\u2013mean size, 50 percentile, and so on\u2013you need a \nhistogram\n.\n\n\nDeclaring Metrics in Python\n\n\nDeclare the metrics and the groups of metrics collected by your worker in the list returned by the \nmetrics()\n function. Each metric is a tuple \n(\nName\n, \nType\n)\n where \nName\n is the name of the metric and \nType\n is the metric type. Each group is a list of metrics tuples. A group corresponds to metrics that will be plotted on the same chart.\n\n\nLet\ns see the following metrics declaration:\n\n\ndef metrics():\n    return [\n        [\n            ('print', 'counter'),\n            ('print_2', 'counter')\n        ],\n        ('dummy', 'histogram')\n    ]\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, three metrics are declared. \nprint\n and \nprint_2\n are \ncounters\n and \ndummy\n is a \nhistogram\n. Moreover, the metrics \nprint\n and \nprint_2\n will be plotted on the same graph.\n\n\nUpdating Metrics\n\n\nYou can update a metric from anywhere inside your worker. Simply call the following function:\n\n\nmzbench.notify(('\nmetric_name\n', '\nmetric_type\n'), \nvalue\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe tuple \n('\nmetric_name\n', '\nmetric_type\n')\n is the same that was used during the metric declaration and identifies the metric to update. \nvalue\n is the value to add to the metric.",
